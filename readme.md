# Blackjack Game

* create a simple text-based BlackJack game
* The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
* The player can stand or hit.
* The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
* need to keep track of the player's total money.
* need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...

And most importantly:

* You must use OOP and classes in some portion of your game. You can not just use functions in your game. Use classes to help you define the Deck and the Player's hand. 


# War Game

* Two players will each start off with half the deck, then they each remove a card.
* compare which card has the highest value, and the player with the higher card wins both cards.
